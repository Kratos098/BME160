    "# Deliverables:\n",
    " - sequenceAnalysis.py module - 35 total points\n",
    " - classes included: \n",
    "     - NucParams, \n",
    "     - ProteinParams, \n",
    "     - FastAreader\n",
    " - genomeAnalyzer.py - 15 total points\n",
    " - possible extra credit - 10 additional points\n",
    " - Due: Monday February 1, 2021 11:55pm\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Congratulations. You have started to build an inventory of some pretty useful functions.  Because these are written as classes, you can easily reuse them. Your ProteinParam class is your first deposit into your very own sequenceAnalysis toolkit.  In Python, these toolkits are called modules.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are also going to start using real sequence files.  The fastA format, described here: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTA_format is very convenient to use and fully capable of storing sequences of many types. You will be reading these from an input file for this assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Genomic analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few things that we can do that mirror and extend the analyses that we did previously on protein sequences. We can calculate composition statistics on the genome (gc content for example), we can calculate relative codon usage in the genome, and we can calculate amino acid composition by translating those codons used the genome.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this lab, I have provided a NucParams class, with the required methods that it implements (see below). You will need to design and write those methods, and these are to be placed in a file called sequenceAnalysis.py This is a __*module*__ that you can use from now on.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will also need to place the ProteinParams class (Lab 3) into this module also. This class will not be used for this assignment, but place it into your toolbox.\n",
    "\n",
    "I have written the FastAreader class.  It is included (below). Keep it as is part of your module for now, you may decide to keep it somewhere else later.\n",
    "\n",
    "The input file for this assignment will be named testGenome.fa, and will be available in Canvas soon. You will not need to submit testGenome.fa, but it will be necessary for your testing.  For development and testing, create a new directory (Lab04) and place the data file (testGenome.fa), your program (genomeAnalyzer.py) and your new module (sequenceAnalysis.py) into your Lab04 directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hints\n",
    "\n",
    " - Python modules have the .py extension as files, but when they are imported, the name without the extension is used in the import statement in your program.\n",
    "\n",
    " - File placement: Make sure to place your program, your sequenceAnalysis module and the required data files in the same folder. This will allow Python to find them. Read over the FastAreader usage to see how to specify file names that you can use for your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Codon frequency calculations\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that NucParams does all of the counting you need. It is responsible for counts of codons and their translated amino acids.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your genomeAnalyzer.py program has the task of determining which codons are preferred for each of the amino acids and calculating the relative percentage.  For any given amino acid, the relative codon usage (percentages) should sum to 100.0%. Notice that Methionine and Tryptophan only have 1 codon that codes for those, so these will have relative codon usages of 100%.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example: Lysine is coded by both AAA (607) and AAG (917) (example counts in parentheses).  From our aaComposition() method, we are given the aaComposition dictionary and we can lookup 'K' to find 1524 counts (these came from those 607+917 codons).  We can then calculate 607/1524 for AAA and 917/1524 for AAG.  The associated percentages are thus: 39.8 for AAA and 60.2 for AAG.\n",
    "\n",
    "AAA = 607/1524 * 100 = 39.8%\n",
    "\n",
    "AAG = 917/1524 * 100 = 60.2%\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Design specification - sequenceAnalysis.py\n",

    "### \\_\\_init\\_\\_\n",
    "\n",
    "The constructor of the class has one optional parameter, a sequence of type string. It may include upper or lower case letters of the set {ACGTUN} or whitespace.  These will be gene sequences and they begin in frame 1.  In other words the first 3 letters of the sequence encode the first AA of the sequence. Carefully consider in what form this class should maintain its data. Is a string the best structure? This class (NucParams) is intended to be very similar to ProteinParam. Make sure to read addSequence() before making this decision, and remember that objects of this class may need to handle an arbitrarily large number of sequences (hint:  dictionaries are good). As a second hint, notice that __init__ and addSequence are doing VERY similar things - you could just make one of them do most of the work.\n",
    "\n",
    "### addSequence() - 5 pts\n",
    "\n",
    "This method must accept new sequences, from the {ACGTUN} alphabet, and can be presumed to start in frame 1. This data must be added to the data that you were given with the __init__ method (if any).\n",
    "\n",
    "### aaComposition() - 10 pts\n",
    "\n",
    "This method will return a dictionary of counts over the 20 amino acids and stop codons.  This dictionary is VERY similar to the lab 3 aaComposition, though you must decode the codon first. The translation table from codon to AA is provided. You are counting amino acids by translating from the proper codon table.\n",
    "\n",
    "### nucComposition() - 10 pts\n",
    "\n",
    "This method returns a dictionary of counts of valid nucleotides found in the analysis. (ACGTNU}. If you were given RNA nucleotides, they should be counted as RNA nucleotides. If you were given DNA nucleotides, they should be counted as DNA nucleotides. Any N bases found should be counted also. Invalid bases are to be ignored in this dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "### codonComposition() - 10 pts\n",
    "\n",
    "This dictionary returns counts of codons. Presume that sequences start in frame 1, accept the alphabet {ACGTUN} and store codons in RNA format, along with their counts. __Any codons found with invalid bases should be discarded__. Discard codons that contain N bases. This means that all codon counts are stored as RNA codons, even if the input happens to be DNA. If you discard a codon, make sure to not alter the frame of subsequent codons.\n",
    "\n",
    "### nucCount()\n",
    "\n",
    "This returns an integer value, summing every valid nucleotide {ACGTUN} found.  This value should exactly equal the sum over the nucleotide composition dictionary."
